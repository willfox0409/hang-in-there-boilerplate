# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

This 'Hang in There' project is a motivational poster web app that allows users to generate, create, save posters with custom images, titles, and quotes. The app solves the problem of limited customization in traditional poster generators, by giving the user some control over their content.
Users can generate random posters from a set of preloaded images, titles, and quotes or create their own by entering custom inputs. They also have the option to save posters to a personal collection for later viewing. In addition to motivational posters, the app includes an Un-motivational Posters section, offering a 'tongue in cheek' alternative to traditional 'inspirational posters'. Users can also delete the un-motivational posters, ensuring their collection stays curated to their preferences.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

This project is hosted on GitHub and can be accessed by opening the index.html file in a browser. No installation is required—simply right-click on index.html and select “Open with Live Server” (if using VS Code with the Live Server extension) or open the file directly in your browser to interact with the app.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)

[Preview of App](https://imgur.com/a/cO03p1t) - I chose the Un-motivational Posters section because it showcases the seamless integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating dynamic DOM manipulation, event handling, and logical decision-making, especially in how posters are displayed, deleted, and persist within the session.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This project was completed over the course of a little more than a week. We were provided with most of the HTML structure and a good portion of the CSS, but only a small part of the JavaScript, requiring us to build out the core functionality ourselves. At this point in the Turing program, I’m nearly halfway through, and this project served as a great opportunity to apply my growing skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic-based problem-solving.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

This project focused on strengthening my ability to read, understand, and build upon existing code while maintaining clean, DRY JavaScript. I worked on writing functions that align with Single Responsibility Principle (handleUnmotivationalPosterClick(event), hideAllSections(), handlePosterSubmission()), manipulating the DOM dynamically, and using array prototype methods to transform and display data. Additionally, I practiced CSS and HTML styling to match the provided design specifications.

Tech Used: I utilized GitHub, VS Code, and Chrome DevTools for development and debugging, along with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to build and style the application.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

One major win from this project was feeling more comfortable simply navigating and reading JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Also, seeing real-time updates to my work was really satisfying, because it provided a tangible sense of progress. A big accomplishment was figuring out how to get deleted posters to stay deleted using a global postersDeleted variable and implementing it correctly in my functions. Another highlight was overcoming technical obstacles with classmates and even being able to HELP others troubleshoot, which is something I hadn’t done much in Mod 1.

The biggest challenges were adjusting to camelCase, new syntax, and JavaScript’s version of scope compared to Ruby. Understanding how the DOM interacts with JavaScript and what parts of the code are truly dynamic was another learning curve. Throughout the project, I leaned on classmates, our code-help channel, online research, and structured guidance from ChatGPT, focusing on step-by-step explanations rather than just being given the answers.
